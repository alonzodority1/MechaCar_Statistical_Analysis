## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![Alt text](MechaCarChallenge.PNG)

2 Variables provide non-random variance: Vehicle_length & Ground_clearance

The slope is not zero as the co-effiencts that are statistically significant are greater than 0

The model predicts the mpg faily well with an adjusted R sqaured of 68 and a very small P value

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

Cummulatively the suspension coils meet the deisgn specification of a sub 100 PSI variance however mesuring the lots individually we see that lot 3 does not meet the specification with a variance of 220.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

With the very small p-value the sample mean is not significantly different from the population mean of 1500

![Alt text](Lot_1_T-Test.PNG)

With the very small p-value the sample mean is not significantly different from the Lot 1 mean

![Alt text](Lot_2_T-Test.PNG)

With the very small p-value the sample mean is not significantly different from the Lot 2 mean

![Alt text](Lot_3_T-Test.PNG)

With the very small p-value the sample mean is not significantly different from the Lot 3 mean

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

To compare the MechaCar with the competition there are 3 key metrics to compare per class:

Cost
Fuel Efficency (both city & highway)
Safety Rating
Trunk Space

The anaylsis would test cost per manuifacturer as a funcition of: MPG (city & highway), Safty rating  and trunk space

Null Hypothesis: The cost of a car is not related to MPG, Safety rating or Trunk Space
ALternate Hypothesis: The cost of a car is dependat on MPG, Safety Rating and Trunk Space

I would use a multiple linear regression to determine the relationships per manufacturer as there are multiple determinate variables

We would need numnerical data show the cost in $, Fuel Effcency in MPG, Safety Rating 1-5 and Trunck space in cubic inches.
